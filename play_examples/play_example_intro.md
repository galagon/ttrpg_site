# Introduction

<span class="green-text"><strong>Jess</strong></span> is DMing for her friends <span class="blue-text"><strong>Karim</strong></span> and <span class="red-text"><strong>Asha</strong></span> in a D&D 5th edition campaign (an ongoing story involving the same characters played over more than one session) in which their characters are heroes trying to bring an evil baron to justice in the name of the queen.

These four scenes will walk through what it looks and feels like to play a session of D&D with each scene demonstrating new “mechanics” (rules and game concepts) building on the last one. At the end of each scene there will be a bullet-point list summarizing the lessons it demonstrated. You can read this if you find it helpful but it is not necessary.
