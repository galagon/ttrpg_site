# Scene 3

*combat and turns, initiative, critical hits, damage types and resistances*

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “After gulping down a health potion and creeping through the dungeons, careful to avoid any ankle-height tripwires this time, you eventually find yourself facing a huge cell with rusty bars and a locked door. Six people - some humans, some hobbits, and a dwarf - are huddled in a corner, looking dirty and despondent. Their clothes have seen better days, and it only takes a second of sizing them up to tell that these are no warriors - they’re probably farmers or townspeople, abducted by the baron’s men for nefarious reasons.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Wait, so we don’t see any guards in here?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Nope, just a few skeletons propped up against the wall.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “I bet you 5 gold pieces those skeletons come to life and attack us.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Spoiler alert! The skeletons shamble up to their feet, grabbed the old weapons arrayed around them and turning their eyeless sockets to you with malevolence. The villagers in the cell begin to scream in fear, but the skeletons only have eyes for the two of you. Roll for initiative!”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “That’s the number at the top of my sheet that says Initiative right?” He rolls a d20 and it comes up 16. “Ok, 16 plus 2 is 18.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> rolls an 11; she looks and sees that she also has a +2 to initiative. “13 for me.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Great. I’m going to make one roll for all three skeletons since they have the same initiative bonus - +2.” She rolls a 5 on a d20. “Ok, the skeletons got a 7 so they’re going to go last. Archis, you’re up first.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Ok, I don’t really understand what the battlefield looks like. How many skeletons are there and how far away are they? Are they all bunched up or spread out? What kind of weapons do they have?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Oops, forgot to describe that. There are three: one up against the bars at the back about 40ft away from you, holding a shortbow. The other two clutch wicked-looking shortsword and stand next to each other, advancing on you, about 10ft away.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “How do we tell apart the two with shortswords?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Umm, I don’t know. Maybe the one on the left is wearing a hat or something.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “A skull cap, hahaha.”
Karim, sarcastically: “Hilarious. Ok, they’re bunched up, maybe I can use a spell that hits them both at the same time.” Karim takes a minute to look through his spells before finding one. “Aha! Burning hands! It hits everyone in a 15ft cone.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “So you’re shooting out flames in a triangle from your hands, they blast out 15ft from you and they’re 15ft wide at the end, cool. Yeah, these guys are only 5ft away from one another, you can definitely get them both, just be careful not to burn Grunda.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Grunda doesn’t like being burned!”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Relax, I’m pretty sure I can just duck around you to get a clear shot.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “How does burning hands work, Karim?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “It says here everyone in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. I deal 3d6 fire damage to whoever fails, and even if they pass the saving throw they still take half damage.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “And what’s your spell-save DC?”
Karim, looking at his sheet: “Looks like it’s 13.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Ok, these skeletons have a +2 to Dexterity saving throws, so they’ll succeed if they roll an 11 or higher.” She rolls two d20s, getting a 6 and a 14. “One passes, one fails. We’ll say the one with the hat passes. Go ahead and roll your damage.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Sweet!” He rolls 3 six-sided dice and they come up 4, 5, and 5. “I rolled well! That’s…14 fire damage. So the one with the hat still takes 7 fire damage, because that’s half of 14.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> Looks down at the skeleton’s ‘stat block’ with all of their information and sees that they have 13HP. “Wow, good for you! You’ve taken one out. What does it look like?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Hmm…I think Archis peaks out from behind Grunda as the skeletons are rushing towards them and says something like, ‘Eat flames, numbskulls!’ and holds his hands out in front of him. His fingers erupt with orange and yellow fire that jets out and smokes the first skeleton, turning its bone to ashes. The other one gets out of the way in time to survive but still gets some of its bones blackened.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Fantastic, but make sure to mark off a first-level spell slot for burning hands.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Will do.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Do you have anything else you’d like to do?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “I don’t know. Burning hands used up my action, and I don’t think I have anything I can do with my bonus action. It only took a little movement to get out in front of Grunda so I think I’m going to use the rest of my movement to back up, get as far away from them as I can.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Alright, the spectacle of your fiery blast is somewhat lessened by you immediately turning and sprinting away behind your larger companion.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “That’s right, get behind me, small man! Grunda will protect you!”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Gee, thanks…”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Asha, that’s your turn. Grunda has just seen one of the skeletons blown to bits but the one with the hat is still rushing to her and there’s one in the back aiming an arrow from a bow. What would you like to do?”
Asha, smiling: “RAGE!”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “What?”
Asha, more calmly: “I would like to use my bonus action to enter a barbarian Rage. It gives me a bunch of cool extra stuff as long as I’m raging, including dealing +2 damage whenever I attack with my axe. Grunda rushes forward to the injured skeleton, screaming her fearsome warcry! I still have my action since Rage only took my bonus action, so I can still attack this turn, right?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Yup.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Delightful. Grunda hefts her massive greataxe above her head and brings it crashing down.” She rolls a d20 and it comes up 17. “Yes! I get +5 to hit, so that’s 22 total!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “That’s so far above its AC - you definitely hit it. Roll damage.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “My greataxe is a d12+3 slashing damage, but with the extra +2 from rage, that’s d12+5.” She rolls a twelve-sided die and it comes up an 11. “11 plus 5 is 16!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> Looks to see that the skeleton, which started with 13HP, took 7 damage from the burning hands and is now only at 6HP. “Wow - you obliterate it. Overkill.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Take that, puny bone-man!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Is that the end of your turn?”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “I’ve still got movement left. I have 30ft and I used 5ft to run up to the skeleton. So I’ve got 25ft left. Is that enough to get me to the archer at the back?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “No sadly, not this turn. It’s 40ft away from you, so you get within 15ft.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Drat. I’ll get it next turn.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “That’s the skeleton’s turn…only, there’s just one survivor. It raises its bow and takes a shot at the barbarian bearing down on it, unafraid.” She rolls a 10 on the die and sees that the skeleton’s shortbow attack has +4 to hit. “Does a 14 hit you, Grunda?”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> Looking at her sheet and seeing that her AC is 14. “Well, if it’s the same as my AC, does it hit or miss?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “If it meets it, it beats it. Hit.” She rolls the damage for the attack - 1d6+2. The six-sided die comes up 5. “7 piercing damage as the arrow hits you in the shoulder.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Wait! One of the things I get from my Rage is that I have resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage! That’s like, all regular weapons, right?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “It is indeed. Resistance means that you only take half, and we round down, so instead of 7 you just take 3.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Ha! Pathetic! I had 23HP, I’m only down to 20HP! I could do this all day!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Now everyone has gone so we’re back to Karim. The skeletons are falling like flies but this archer might still be able to hurt you. What would you like to do?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “I’m a little worried about it running away and bringing more monsters or guards to fight us. I don’t want that to happen. I have this cantrip ray of frost that lowers its speed if it hits, I think I’ll use that.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “What’s the range on that spell?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “120ft.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Oh yeah, you’re definitely within 120ft.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Great. This spell tells me I have to make a spell attack roll, there’s no saving throws involved. So I’m going just going to roll and add…” He sees that his spell attack bonus is +5 “5.” He rolls the d20 and it lands on 20. “Jess, Asha, look! I got a natural 20!”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> High-fives Karim.

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Excellent luck! A nat20 means a critical hit, so you get to roll twice as many dice.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “I think ray of frost normally deals 1d8 cold damage. So, 2d8.” The d8s come up 5 and 8. “Lucky again! That’s 13 damage.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “That is exactly enough to take out this last skeleton. Asha, you’re charging down this archer when all of a sudden a bolt of blue-white energy streaks through the air past you and slams into your target, freezing its bones until they’re so brittle they fall apart.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Grunda’s not too happy about her target getting knocked out before she could get to it, but she’s going to use her pent up Rage to crash into the bars of the cell and break them open instead.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “That’s going to be really hard to do, like a DC 20 Athletics check.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “That’s fine. I’m still in Rage so I have advantage on all Strength checks, and Athletics is based on Strength.” She rolls her d20 twice and it comes up 1 and 16. “Take the highest, so that’s 16 plus 5 - 21! Nothing can stop Grunda!”

<span class="green-text">Jess, surprised:</span> “Umm, ok, I guess you…break right through the bars and send them flying, frightening the prisoners inside.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Have no fear, helpless weaklings! Grunda is here to save you! Celebrate!”

## Lessons

- When fighting breaks out, everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative bonus - the creature with the highest result gets their turn first, then the creature with the next highest total, and so on
- The DM can decide to make a single initiative roll for multiple monsters of the same type so that they act together in order to save time (this is up to them, sometimes they may wish to split them up)
- The DM tries to describe the scene in enough detail for the players to make decisions, but the players can always ask for more information on what their character can see and hear
- It is the player’s responsibility to provide the information related to any features they use or spells they cast (how many targets, what area, how long it takes, how long it lasts, if it requires a saving throw, etc.)
- Every creature on their turn gets an action, a bonus action, and movement
- Your character’s “speed” (usually 30ft) is the distance they can move in a turn
- Attacking with weapons and casting most spells require you to use your action, so your action is very important, but there are other things you can do with it like Dashing, which gives you double movement
- Bonus actions are used for very specific things like Grunda activating her Rage; your character might not have anything they can do with their bonus action (yet!)
- Monsters have saving throw modifiers/bonuses just like PCs
- If your character casts spells like Archis, you will have a spell-save DC, which is the DC of any saving throws you force other creatures to make with your spells; it doesn’t matter which spell you’re using, the DC will always be the same
- Every weapon on your character sheet will have a to-hit bonus based on your Strength or Dexterity which you add to your d20 roll when you make an attack; if the total of your roll and this bonus is equal to or greater than your target’s AC/armour-class, you hit them
- Every weapon on your character sheet will list its damage, like 1d8+1; if you hit, you roll these dice and add the modifiers (in this case, rolling an 8-sided die and adding 1 to the result) to determine how much damage you do
- Different attacks, spells, and effects will deal different types of damage (like slashing or psychic or cold); damage types usually don’t matter very much but sometimes a creature will have resistance to (take half damage), vulnerability to (take double damage), or immunity from (take no damage) certain damage types, like Grunda being resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while Raging
- Casting spells that say “make a spell attack” works just like attacking with a weapon, but you use your character’s spell attack modifier which will be the same for every spell
- When there are no more threats to the characters (either because they have won or surrendered or run away), the DM announces that combat is over and the game returns to being free-flowing and turnless
