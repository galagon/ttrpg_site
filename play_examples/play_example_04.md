<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Ok, you’ve led the prisoners out of the dungeon after convincing them that you’re on the same side, and you’re ushering them through the side gate you found in the castle. You haven’t been spotted yet, but it’s only a matter of time - dozens of people can’t keep hidden forever. Sure enough, you see a moving shape further along the wall and a second later a horn blast echoes out, alerting everyone to your presence.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Well, we made it pretty far before getting found out. Are there guards close enough to catch us before the last prisoner gets through the gate?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> She has already decided she wants the end of their escape to be eventful and high stakes, and what would be more eventful than a confrontation with the baron himself? Once again she rolls some meaningless d20s behind her DM screen as if randomly determining what happens next, then gasps as if surprised by a particularly high or low roll. “As you cover the last of the poor villagers as they run out through the walls, you see a hulking shape at the other side of the courtyard, clunking slowly toward you, completely alone. A few more footsteps and he steps into the light for you to recognize Baron Redwine in a suit of shiny metal armour inlaid with gold patterns, a silver and red cape billowing from his shoulders, and two glowing red eyes staring straight at the two of you from the eye slit of his helmet. With a shhhhhing! sound that seems to ring through the otherwise empty courtyard, he draws his massive two-handed greatsword.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Oh crap.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “His sword - it’s not bigger than Grunda’s axe, right?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span>, smiling: “It’s a little bigger.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Grrrr, Grunda hates him even more, now. Let’s charge him!”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “What are you talking about, Asha?! Remember, we learned that he’s signed a deal with demons - he’s an incredible warrior, he’s got magical powers, and there are only two of us!”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Exactly, and I’m an incredible warrior and you’ve got magical powers. I don’t see what the problem is.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “We were just supposed to spy on him and report back to the queen.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “The mission has changed. This is a golden opportunity, he doesn’t have any of his guards to back him up. We may never get him this vulnerable again! We can save a lot of lives by capturing him now and bringing him to the queen in chains!”

<span class="blue-text">Karim, sighing:</span> “Ok, ok - let’s do this. But if things start to go bad, we’re running away, ok?”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Deal.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Roll initiative, then.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “5”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “16”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> Gets a 13 for the baron, but decides not to tell them. “Grunda is first this time.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Yes! Is he within 30ft?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Just.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “I use my whole move to run up to him and then with my action I’m going to draw my axe - I can still attack, right?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Right. You get to interact with one object for free each turn, so drawing your axe doesn’t cost you your action.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Great. I go into a Rage.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “You’ve only got a limited number of those per day, right?”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “I do? Oh crap. Yeah, it says I can only use it two times and I only get it back when I take a long rest. So I guess this will be my last one. Let’s make it worth it. I attack!” She rolls her d20 and it comes up 12. “That’s a 17 to hit!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Miss.” She double checks that the baron’s AC is 19. “He raises his greatsword like it’s as light as a feather and manages to get it up in between you two. Despite how easily he moves it, it’s solid, and your greataxe slides off the side, hitting the ground instead of your target.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “What?! Are you kidding me? 17 doesn’t hit him?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Sorry, but this guy is heavily armoured-up - he’s going to be a lot harder to hit than some lame skeletons.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Grrr…I’ll get him next turn.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “If there is a next turn. You’ve used your action, bonus action, movement, and you’ve interacted with an object - that’s really all you can do. Baron Redwine goes next. Grunda expects him to return a strike with his sword, but he doesn’t. Keeping one hand on his weapon, he raises a gauntleted hand and makes a fist. Green flames burst into existence around it, and before you can recover from your surprise, you feel something on your ankle.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Crap.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Archis sees it first and shouts out a warning to Grunda. Ghostly green hands are rising from the ground and grasping at Grunda as if trying to grab a hold and pull her down, but they swat through her flesh instead. Grunda, you feel a deep sense of tiredness, like the energy and life is being drained from your body. Make a Constitution saving throw.”

<span class="red-text">Asha, nervous now:</span> “Ok, I’m good at those.” Rolls a 6 on her d20 and groans. “Ok, plus 5…that’s 11.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> shakes her head: “Not enough, the DC for this feature is actually 17.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “17? But Archis’s spell-save DC is only 13!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Yeah, Archis didn’t make a deal with a demon.” She picks up the damage dice - 4d10. She rolls them all at once and grimaces as they come up 10, 9, 3, and 4. “Oooooh….don’t be mad Asha.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “What? Why”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “That’s…” doing mental math, “26 necrotic damage.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Ok, ok, but I only take half of it because I’m Raging, right? Like before?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span>, shaking her head. “I’m sorry, but this is necrotic damage. You’re only resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage - so basically, damage from weapons. You haven’t got any special protection against magic like this. That’s why he didn’t attack you with his sword.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> Puts her head down on the table and mumbles. “I’m down.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “What happened to your infinite barbarian HP?”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Hey, 20 is a lot of HP for level 2. It’s just not enough to survive ghost-hands, apparently.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Archis, you see your best friend and oldest travelling companion, Grunda the Fierce, fall to the ground as her eyes close into unconsciousness. You can tell she isn’t dead, but Baron Redwine is standing over her, sword in hand. It doesn’t look good.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> Jess! You’re supposed to be our friend!”

<span class="green-text">Jess, shrugging:</span> “Sorry dude. I wasn’t unfair, I gave you the chance to get away and you knew how powerful he was. Even when you decided to attack, you had a chance of taking him out, it was just a long-shot. I can’t roll back the clock now, what’s done is done.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “No no no…this can’t happen.” He leafs through his spells, knowing that he only has one spell slot left - one opportunity to save his friend. “I don’t have any healing spells. I could try stabilizing her, but I’d have to make a Medicine check and I’m not good at those. Could I run up and grab her and run away?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Grunda is pretty heavy and you’re not very strong. You could do it, but it would mean moving slowly to drag her. Plus, Grunda is right up there with the baron. If you get within range of his sword and then leave that range, he gets to use his reaction to make an opportunity attack.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “What’s that again?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “He gets a free attack on you with whatever weapon he’s holding. All creatures can do it if someone else close to them runs away. You only get one reaction between your turns so he can’t do it over and over, but that greatsword looks pretty wicked and you are not wearing armour.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “How do I avoid taking an attack of opportunity?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “You can take the Disengage action - anyone can. But that’s your whole action. Running up, grabbing Grunda, disengaging, running away…you’re talking about a lot of turns here. You definitely can’t do all of this before his next turn. Turning around and running after the prisoners through the gate is always an option. In that heavy armour, the baron probably can’t catch you.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Grunda would never run away if I was in danger.” He finds the spell he was looking for. “Aha! Here it is! I may not have any spells that can heal Grunda, but I can do this. I cast Tasha’s Hideous Laughter!”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Who’s Tasha?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “No idea. I guess the witch who invented the spell.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “What does it do?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim, reading:</span> “He needs to make a Wisdom saving throw against my spell-save DC, so 13. If he succeeds, nothing happens. If he fails, he’s overcome with laughter - he falls prone and becomes incapacitated.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “What does that mean?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Prone and incapacitated are just conditions he’ll be under. Prone means on the ground - I guess you’re probably prone now, too, since you fell down when you got knocked unconscious.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “And incapacitated means he can’t act. That’s pretty powerful - if it works. How long does it last?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Up to a minute. But he gets to repeat the save at the end of each of his turns, and if he succeeds even once the spell goes away, so it probably won’t last a full minute, even if it works in the first place.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Ok, it’s your call. Are you casting it?”
Karim, thinking hard. “Yes. Yes I am. Here goes nothing.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> Rolls a d20 after checking to see that the baron has a +5 to Wisdom saving throws. She rolls a 6 for him, but doesn’t say the result out loud immediately. She draws it out, suppressing a smile as Karim and Asha watch her face for a sign. “The baron, standing victorious over his barbarian foe, turns his gaze across the courtyard to his next target: the wizard Archis who is even now raising his shaky hands in a last ditch attempt to save the day. The baron smiles under his helmet. ‘Pathetic. You think that a young, spindly little spellslinger such as yourself could overcome the blessings that the Demon Lord has bestowed upon me?’ He barks out a harsh laugh. And then another. And then, to his surprise, another.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim and Asha:</span> “YES!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “He soon finds himself falling to his knees, unable to support his own weight and barely able to draw breath. The situation has become unbearably funny to him and he doesn’t know why, only that he can’t stop laughing. He pounds his gauntlett, flaming fist against the ground at the hilarity of it all, giving you the opening you need.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “I run up, but I used my action to cast the spell so I can’t do anything more this turn.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Then we come around to Grunda. Asha, give me a death saving throw.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “That sounds sinister. How do I do that again?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Just roll a d20. You don’t add anything to it. If it’s a 10 or higher, that’s a success. If it’s a 9 or lower…”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “I DIE?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Well, not necessarily, you need to fail three times before that happens.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> Rolls a d20 - it comes up 10. “Right on the line! Success!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Good for you! Get three successes and you stabilize, which means you’re not in danger of dying, but you’ll still be unconscious and unable to help your friends.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “I have one last healing potion in my inventory. If Karim can feed that to me, will I be conscious again?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Yes, any amount of healing and you get back up and wipe away any death save success or fails you had. But first, it’s the baron’s turn. He can’t do anything, but at the end of his turn he has another chance to break through the spell. She rolls a 7.”Does a 12 meet or beat your spell-save DC, Karim?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Pheph! It just fails! He’s doubled over for another turn, then. Never have I been so happy to be laughed at.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “That’s your turn, Karim.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Great - it costs an action to feed someone a potion or to drink it myself, right?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Right.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Ok Grunda, drink up! We’re getting out of this terrible castle!” He pretends to pass her a drink.

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Roll 2d4+2 to see how much you heal her.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> Rolls two 1s. “Rats, it’s the lowest possible result, only 4HP.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Fine by me, I just need a little juice to get up off the ground.” She marks her HP as “4” and erases the successful death save she had written down.

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Karim, are you going to use your movement to get away?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “You bet. Grunda, you can handle yourself from here. I retreat towards the gate. Wait, I’m next to the baron, does he get an opportunity attack against me?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Normally yes, but let me just check the incapacitated condition in the book. Ok, no, he can’t hurt you as you move away - opportunity attacks take your reaction and apparently incapacitated creatures lose their reaction, too. Ok so the villagers you freed are waiting there, anxiously watching your fight with the baron and breathing sighs of relief now that the situation isn’t quite so desperate. However, you do hear the sound of metal boots thundering against the stone in the distance. You know the baron’s troops are coming to protect their leader. You maybe have a few turns until they get here. Asha, that’s you.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Ok, no more charging in without thinking. How do I stand up from prone?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “It takes half of your normal movement.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Ok, I’m going to Dash with my action so I can move farther. So 30ft + 30ft is 60ft. And then I subtract 15ft to stand up, yeah?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> Nods

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Cool, so I get 45ft away from him.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “I’m going to call it here. The baron is slow and still laughing and his warriors will take a few rounds to catch up. If you and the prisoners sprint as fast as you can, you can get far enough away that they can’t catch you. You manage to make it out of Castle Redwine without your heads on your shoulders, the baron’s secret letters in your pockets, and a dozen very thankful peasants behind you. You’re on your way back to inform the queen and receive your reward!”
Karim lets out a sigh: “I can’t believe we did it. I thought we were going to get captured for sure, at the end, there.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Thanks for having my back, even when I didn’t make the smartest choice. I’m still so mad at the baron, though. I wish we got to take him out.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Same.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span>, smiling: “Oh, I think you’ll be seeing the baron again. This isn’t the end, not by a long-shot. You’ve disrupted and exposed his plans, and like any good villain, he’ll stop at nothing to get his revenge against you. But that’s a story for next week.”

## Lessons

- On your turn in combat, you can interact with an object once without spending an action or bonus action (Asha could draw her greataxe and attack in the same turn); any interactions after the first (like opening a door or grabbing a sword up off of the ground) requires you to use your action 
- Not every challenge in D&D is meant to be overcome with force; keep in mind that your PCs are powerful but they may face monsters and villains who are too dangerous for them until they get to higher levels; there is almost always more than one way to complete your mission, fighting is just one
- If it’s your turn and you are at 0HP and haven’t been stabilized, you make a death saving throw which is a d20 check that you don’t add any bonuses to; if you get a 9 or lower it counts as a failure but a 10 or higher counts as a success (1s are really bad, 20s are really good)
- Getting three death save successes means that you stabilize and no longer need to make these checks; but get three failures and your character will die, so make sure to heal or stabilize your friends before they get too many failures!
- A PC at 0HP who is brought back up to 1HP or higher through healing no longer has to make death saves and erases the death saves they’ve already made
- Even without healing you can try to stabilize a friend at 0HP by using your action to make a DC 10 Medicine check (Medicine is one of skills based on your Wisdom); if you succeed they don’t return to consciousness but they no longer make death saves
DMs don’t normally make death saving throws for NPCs (they usually just consider them stable but unconscious, “banished”, or dead when they get to 0HP based on what the players want), though they can choose to if it seems appropriate
- Every creature - PCs and NPCs - have one reaction between turns; you won’t use your reaction most of the time; the most common time it comes up is when a creature leaves the attack range of an enemy (usually 5ft) without taking the Disengage action, and the enemy gets to use their reaction to make an attack called an opportunity attack
- Creatures can be affected by conditions that hinder them without necessarily dealing damage; for example, being prone like Grunda was leaves you vulnerable to close-range attacks and requires half of your movement to stand up, while being incapacitated like Baron Redwine was means that you can’t act at all on your turn; there are a lot of possible conditions, you don’t need to worry about knowing them all
