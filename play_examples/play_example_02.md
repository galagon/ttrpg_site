<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “The dungeons are quiet. Almost too quiet. Empty cells containing gruesome torture devices line both sides of the hall that you’re tip-toeing down. There are sconces for holding torches on either side but it looks like they haven’t held anything in a long time - everything is pitch black here.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Wait, Archis has darkvision from being a tiefling! So I can at least see a little bit out to 60ft.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Lucky you. Grunda is just a plain old human. No darkvision here.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “I think you might have torches in your inventory. Check your sheet.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Oh yeah, I do!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “But you won’t be able to hold your two-handed greataxe if you’re holding a torch in one hand.” 

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Awww, but I love my greataxe!”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Wait, I actually have a spell for this - ah, here it is: light. I can touch an object and make it radiate light.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Awesome, do it to my axe - I’ll be holding it out in front of me anyway.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Archis touches the massive axe and it immediately begins to glow a warm, yellow light, allowing you to see 40ft. in front of you.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Hmm, I only have two spell slots left…wait a minute, no, light is a cantrip so it doesn’t use a spell slot! I can use it as many times as I want to!”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Great! Now able to see, you proceed cautiously down the hallway. I’m going to need a Perception check from both of you.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Uh oh, that sounds bad.” He rolls a d20 and gets a 1. “Well, there’s no way I passed that.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> rolls a d20 and gets a 4. “Add 4…does an 8 pass?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “It definitely doesn’t. As you two are walking along, wary for threats from ahead and behind, you aren’t paying attention to what’s on the ground. Grunda, you realize a moment too late that your leg just hit a thin, almost-invisible tripwire. I’m going to need Dexterity saving throws from both of you.”
Karim, groaning: rolls a d20 and gets an 11, and checks his sheet to see that his bonus for Dexterity saving throws is +1. “Does a 12 pass?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> checks her notes to see that the trap’s DC is 15. “I’m sorry man, that’s not going to cut it. Asha?”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Is this an effect that I can see?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “What?”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Whatever’s happening that’s causing us to need a Dexterity saving throw - can I see it coming? I have this barbarian class feature called Danger Sense, it gives me advantage on Dexterity saving throws as long as I can see the effect.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Oh wow - yes, you can see these swinging blades coming down out of the walls towards you and you need to jump out of the way. You do have advantage on this from Danger Sense, so roll twice and take the highest.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> rolls her d20 and gets a 5. She then picks it up and rerolls it, getting a 14. “Phew. Ok, I ignore the 5 and take the 14. I have a +2 for Dexterity saving throws…does 16 pass?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “16 passes! Grunda, with your honed survival instincts you’re able to dodge out of the way of these sharp blades that come swinging down like pendulums…”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Can I do a barrel roll?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Sure, why not. You barrel roll out of the way. Meanwhile, Archis, your years of studying magic in dusty libraries have not given you the same level of fitness, and you’re unable to dodge out of the way in time.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Figures.”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> checking her notes and seeing that the trap deals 2d8 slashing damage, Jess rolls two eight-sided dice. “Archis takes…” the dice come up 7 and 4. “Ouch! 7 plus 4 is 11, Archis takes 11 points of slashing damage as the blades swipe past, hitting his shoulder and tearing up his wizard’s robes.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “11, are you kidding me? I only have 14 maximum HP! That means I’m down to…14 subtract 11 is…3 HP! I’m practically a goner already!”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Are you ok to keep going?”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “I mean, I don’t know. I’m above 0HP so I’m still conscious but if I get hit one more time, I’m probably going to go down. I could even die. Neither of us have healing spells, and we can’t stop to take a break before we make sure those prisoners are alright.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “I feel bad, it was my idea to come down here in the first place. Here, Grunda has a healing potion in her inventory. Take it.” Asha erases the healing potion from the inventory section of her character sheet.

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Are you sure? Healing potions can be expensive and I know Grunda was saving up money for a bigger, cooler axe.”

<span class="red-text">Asha:</span> “Axes can be replaced. Friends can’t.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> “Thank you! So, Jess, how much HP do I get back when I drink it?”

<span class="green-text">Jess:</span> “Let me check….it says 2d4+2. So roll two four-sided dice, add them together, and add 2.”

<span class="blue-text">Karim:</span> picks up his four-sided die and rolls it, getting a 3. He picks it up and rolls again, getting a 1. “Ok, 3 plus 1 plus 2…that’s 6HP back. I was at 3HP before, so now I’m at 9, out of my maximum of 14HP. It’s still not a lot, but I can probably take another hit without going down - that’s one less thing to worry about.”

## Lessons

- The DM does their best to describe what characters see, hear, feel, and smell in their environment, taking account of the fact that different PCs might have different senses such as darkvision
- Every PC has an inventory of items that might come in handy
- Cantrips are spells that do not require spell slots, so they can be used an unlimited number of times
- Saving throws work just like skill checks in that you roll a d20 and add a certain value, checking to see if the total is at least as high as a DC/difficulty-class; the main difference is that saving throws are usually made to avoid something bad happening to you as opposed to seeing if an action you take succeeds
- “Advantage” is when you make a check and are able to roll twice, taking the higher of the two values; advantage can be due to features (like Grunda’s Danger Sense) or due to situations (like making an attack roll against someone you’re hidden from)
- Players can use inspiration that they’ve been given to give themselves advantage on a roll
- The DM and the players work together to tell the story - here, Jess described the way the blades came down and Asha suggested a cool way for Grunda to leap out of the way; she had already passed the check, the description of what happened could not have changed the result, but both DMs and players have freedom in describing what it looks like when someone succeeds or fails (like a barrel roll out of the way) and/or why they succeeded or failed (like Archis having spent too much time in the library)
- Dice that are not d20s are mainly used for dealing and healing damage - here, Jess used d8s to determine how much damage the swinging blades would do, and Karim used d4s to determine how much health the healing potion would restore
- HP/health-points represent a creature’s vitality, and when damage reduces you to 0HP you fall unconscious; every creature has a maximum HP that they cannot go above
