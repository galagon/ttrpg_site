<strong>Abilities:</strong> six numbers representing your base attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma; more important than the raw number is the “modifier”, which is how much you add to checks that rely on that ability (e.g., if your Strength is 14, you have +2 to Strength checks and you don’t really need to remember the “14” because you probably won’t use it)

<strong>Action:</strong> when you are in combat, you have one action each turn; most things (attacking, casting most spells) require your action

<strong>Advantage:</strong> when you make a check and are allowed to roll the d20 twice and take the higher number; this can happen because of a feature of your character or the DM can decide you get advantage because of the situation; the opposite of disadvantage

<strong>Armour class (AC):</strong> a number representing how hard a creature is to hit with an attack; this is a type of DC but the DM doesn’t set it in their head because every creature has their own armour class

<strong>Attack roll:</strong> a roll you make with your d20 to try and hit someone with an attack; you add the weapon or spell’s modifier and if the result is at least as high as the target’s AC, you hit

<strong>Background:</strong> what your character did before they were an adventurer

<strong>Bonus action:</strong> when you are in combat, you have one bonus action each turn in addition to your regular action; you may not have things you can do with your bonus action

<strong>Campaign:</strong> when a group of people plays a story with the same characters over more than one session

<strong>Cantrips (0th-level spells):</strong> a type of spell that can be cast an infinite number of times and doesn’t require spell slots - they are usually not very powerful

<strong>Challenge rating (CR):</strong> a number attached to a monster to represent how dangerous it is., e.g., a CR 2 monster should be a reasonable challenge for a party of four level 2 adventurers; you don’t need to know this, it’s just a tool to help DMs

<strong>Charisma:</strong> the ability score that represents your force of personality and how good you are at communicating with and manipulating other people; bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use charisma to cast spells

<strong>Check:</strong> when the DM asks you to roll a d20 and add a certain number to determine whether you succeed at something; skill checks, saving throws, and attack rolls are all checks; you succeed at a check if your check result is at least as high as the DC (see “Difficulty class”)

<strong>Class:</strong> one of thirteen types of adventurers that you can choose for your PC; this is one of the most important features of your character and determines many things about them

<strong>Constitution:</strong> the ability score that represents how hearty your body is and how good you are at shrugging off sickness and injury

<strong>Critical hit:</strong> when you make an attack roll and roll a 20 on the dice (a “natural 20”) you automatically hit and you get to roll twice as many dice for your damage

<strong>Critical miss:</strong> when you make an attack roll and roll a 1 on the die (a “natural 1”) you automatically miss

<strong>d20 (or d4, d6, etc.):</strong> refers to a specific die, the number after the “d” is how many faces the die has

<strong>Damage type:</strong> the way in which damage hurts someone, like poison, slashing, fire, etc.

<strong>Death saving throw:</strong> a check a player makes when their character is at 0HP and hasn’t been stabilised, with a 10 or higher being a success and anything lower being a failure; three successes stabilizes you, but your character dies if they get three failures

<strong>Dexterity:</strong> the ability score that represents your hand-eye coordination, your agility, and your reflexes

<strong>Difficulty class (DC):</strong> a number that your check needs to be at least as high as to succeed; armour-class is a type of DC

<strong>Disadvantage:</strong> the opposite of advantage - you roll your d20 twice and use the lowest of the two numbers

<strong>Gold (gp):</strong> the main currency in the game; 1 gold piece (gp) is worth 10 silver pieces (sp) and 100 copper pieces (cp)

<strong>Health points (HP):</strong> a number representing how much vitality a creature has and that is reduced by taking damage; creatures become unconscious when they have 0HP and they return to their maximum HP value after taking a long rest

<strong>Hit dice:</strong> a limited pool of dice each character has that can be used to restore HP on a short rest

<strong>Player character (PC):</strong> the main characters of the story, each of which is controlled by a different player around the table

<strong>Player’s Handbook (PHB):</strong> the main rulebook for D&D

<strong>Proficiency:</strong> a number you get to add to any attack, skill check, or saving throw in which you are proficient; this is +2 for all low-level characters; proficiency in a skill or a saving throw is represented by a filled-in bubble next to it; you can assume you are proficient in all weapons and spells that appear on your character sheet

<strong>Race:</strong> a type of fantasy creature that your character can be, e.g., human, dwarf, dragonborn, orc; some people prefer to call this “species” which is more accurate

<strong>Reaction:</strong> when in combat, you have one reaction between each of your turns; reactions are used in response to something happening (e.g., you can use your reaction to cast the spell feather fall in response to you or a friend falling)

<strong>Rest:</strong> your party can take short rests and long rests; short rests take an hour and allow you to restore some HP and some characters’ features whereas long rests take 8 hours and require you to sleep, but you restore all of your HP, spell slots, and features

<strong>Saving throws:</strong> checks the DM will ask you to make to avoid something bad happening to you (e.g., leaping out of the way of a dragon’s fire breath); there is one saving throw for each of the six abilities

<strong>Session:</strong> a single time that a group of people sits down at a table together to play D&D; multiple sessions with the same character are called a campaign

<strong>Speed:</strong> the amount your character can move on a given turn in combat; using your action to “Dash” allows you to move twice as far

<strong>Spell:</strong> a magical effect that certain creatures can produce; each spell’s description contains information on what it does, how long it takes to cast, what level it is, and whether it requires an attack roll from the caster or a saving throw from the target

<strong>Spell level:</strong> represents the power of a spell, from 0 to 9; low-level characters can only cast cantrips and 1st-level spells

<strong>Strength:</strong> the ability score that represents how physically strong you are

<strong>Subclass:</strong> PCs pick a subclass at level 1, 2, or 3 depending on their class; your choice of subclasses depends on your class and each one represents a specialty (e.g., rangers can choose “Beastmaster” which gives them an animal friend, or “Hunter” which makes them better at archery)

<strong>Unconscious:</strong> what happens when you fall to 0HP or fall asleep; while unconscious, you can’t do anything on your turn
