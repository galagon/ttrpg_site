# Where do they go from there?

This was the end of this session of play, but Archis and Grunda’s story could go in any direction from here. Maybe in the next session they report back to the queen who rewards them with magical items that give them fun powers, or with money that they use to go shopping. Maybe Jess decides that the players have come far enough that they’ve earned a “level-up”, and they take their PCs to level 3, choosing new spells and features in the process. Maybe Jess decides to include the backstory that Grunda mentioned, by having Grunda discover that the warlord who abducted her family is actually working with Baron Redwine. Maybe Karim decides that Archis is going to open up a used-book store.

Any combination of these things could happen. Or maybe Karim and Asha decide they want to try playing different characters or a different game besides D&D, so they stop playing this campaign and never come back to it. That’s fine, too!

The point is that the three of them are going to figure out what happens next together. It’s important to know that Jess is throwing challenges at the players for them to overcome, but she isn’t the bad guy - she wants them to succeed, even though she’s “playing” the bad guys. Also, Jess doesn’t know how the story is going to go any more than Karim and Asha do. The DM doesn’t “write” the story, they’re just one person at the table helping to tell it with everyone else. Maybe Jess thinks that the PCs are going to try to stop the baron next, but all Karim and Asha want to do is open that used book-store! Or maybe Archis manages to convince the baron to change his ways and help them fight the demons in order to save his family, completely throwing a wrench in the plans Jess had made!

Playing a single session of D&D is fun and still allows you to make stories with each other, but playing a campaign offers limitless possibilities. PCs change just like the characters in your favourite books, movies, and TV shows - they gain new powers, but they also learn valuable lessons and grow as people. The difference is that in D&D, YOU decide what happens next with your character. That might be falling in love, saving the world, or just getting rich - whatever it is, they can do it, it just might require fighting a few dragons and exploring a few dungeons!

If this sounds overwhelming, don’t worry - every adventurer gets to their destination by putting one foot in front of the other. D&D has a lot of rules, mostly about combat and spells, but the good news is that you don’t have to know them all. You don’t really have to know any of them, as long as you have the basic rules nearby or somebody else at the table knows them. You don’t even need to have combat in your campaign - if you want to play D&D but never get in a fight, you can absolutely do that (just make sure everyone agrees). The rules are there to help make the game fun; the first and most important rule is that if your group is not having fun because of certain rules, then throw them out and tell the stories you want to tell!

## Examples of Campaigns and Stories
Here are just a few examples of stories that I’ve seen people tell using D&D and other TTRPGs:
* Teenagers go to a magic high-school for adventurers and deal with possessed lunch-ladies, werewolf guidance counsellors, and divorced parents
* Forest animals try to solve a Sherlock-Holms-style mystery 
* Parts of someone’s mind work together to help their human navigate the world and tackle mental illness (like Pixar’s “Inside Out”)
* A group of dads from Earth arrive in a fantasy land to try and find their missing sons and become better role models for them
* Superheroes with secret identities fight villains to keep their modern-day city safe
* Fairy aristocrats use magic and scheming to try to out-do one another at a fancy “Pride-and-Prejudice”-like gala, and maybe find true love in the process
* Bears pull off a bank heist to steal honey
* Kids on bicycles confront a secret magical threat in their sleepy 1980s town
* If you don’t like fantasy settings and swords and spells, there are a lot of other TTRPGs that you might like more than D&D!
