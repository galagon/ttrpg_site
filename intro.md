## What is a TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game)?
Tabletop RPGs (TTRPGs) are collaborative storytelling games. The storytelling part refers to the narrative, the characterization, the stories that we craft independent of any set of rules or any gaming system. These stories are what makes a TTRPG different from something like a video game or board game and make it a little more like a book or a TV show. The game part refers to the rules and limits that we play within and how characters are represented by numbers (e.g., “My character is stealthy” = having a +6 bonus to the “Stealth” skill). These things (sometimes called “mechanics”) are what make a TTRPG different from something like a book or a TV show and make it a little more like a video game or a board game

At its core, you’re just imagining a made-up world and working together to decide what happens in it for the sake of a good story and a fun game. There are thousands of TTRPGs; D&D is just one that is fantasy-themed. Other TTRPGs are about horror, romance, sci-fi, mystery/crime-solving, pretty much anything you can imagine.

## What do I need to have to play?
Only a few things:

* Character sheets for each player, either printed out or digital
* Either the Player’s Handbook or the Core Rules
* Pencils, if you’re using paper character sheets
* A set of dice for each person or a dice rolling app; a full set of dice contains a d4, a d6, a d8, a d10, a d12, and a d20
* Your imagination!

That’s it. Really. Character sheets, the Core Rules, and dice rolling apps are free, meaning that you don’t have to spend any money. A copy of the Player’s Handbook (talked about under the “Core Rules” section) is helpful when you’re first creating your character, but if you can borrow that from someone (like me!) you’re all set. 
Some people use little figures or tokens and a large grid (called a “battle mat”) to track where their characters are in a fight or other high-intensity situation. These things can be nice to have once you get used to playing and if you have more complicated fights, but you do not need them since the action is all inside your mind.

## What does “Fifth Edition” mean?
The newest edition of D&D is the 5th edition. It tends to be easier to learn than the older ones, and people prefer playing it. If you see any book or product that’s for an older edition, it probably won’t work with this.

## How does it work?
There is one Dungeon Master (“DM”, sometimes called “Game Master”/”GM”) and everyone else is a player. The players control the player characters (“PCs”) who are the main characters of the story you’re telling together, while the DM controls everything else.
+++
At the beginning of a session, the DM describes the situation the PCs find themselves in, then the players can say what they would like their characters to do. The DM then describes how the world around them reacts to their actions, after which the players say what they would like their characters to do next. The PCs are not all-powerful - if they say “I’m going to punch down this castle!”, that’s not going to work (the DM has the final say on what is or isn’t possible). When someone tries to do something that has a chance of success and a chance of failure (like scaling a wall or convincing a merchant to give you a discount), they make a “check”: they roll a twenty-sided die (called a “d20”) and tell the DM what the number is after they add the number on the character sheet that matches (e.g., “Athletics” to scale the wall and “Persuasion” to get the discount). The DM gets to decide if that’s high enough to succeed; more difficult actions require higher rolls.
+++
And that’s it. The PCs act, the world reacts, the PCs react, and you keep going until you reach the end of your session!

## What is “roleplaying”, anyway?
“Roleplaying” means pretending to be a character. This means thinking like your character. There is no script, so you have to decide on the fly what your character would do in different situations. You can create and play a character who is similar to you, but most people find it fun to roleplay as someone a little bit different. If you’re shy, try playing as someone outgoing. If you’re confident, maybe try making a character who is insecure.
+++
When you’re new to roleplaying, it’s a good idea to play a character who is generally “good”. Playing a character who is evil, mean, or very selfish can be difficult and make the game uncomfortable for you and others. But, no one is perfect - perfect characters are less interesting than characters with at least one “flaw”, whether it’s greed, cowardice, pride, or something else.
+++
Your character also has a backstory, what happened to them before this adventure they’re embarking on. Was their life peaceful or scary? Did they come from a big family or did they not know their parents at all? Have they been all over the world, or have they never left their sleepy home-town? These are all questions that you get to answer for them!

## Navigating the Site

The [“Resources”](resources/core_rules.md) section explains where you can get the D&D rules and has links to some helpful guides online
+++
You don’t need to read the [“Examples of Play”](play_examples/play_example_intro.md) section if you don’t want to, it’s an example of what it looks like when people sit down to play the game and contains lessons about some of the different rules
+++
If you’re unsure about what a word or phrase means, the [“Glossary”](glossary.md) probably has the definition
