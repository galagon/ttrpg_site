# Core Rules

## What do the core rules include?
The core rules are a shortened version of the Player’s Handbook (PHB) and contain just about all of the information you need to run D&D - they tell you how skill checks work, how combat works, how to create a character, how spells work, etc. The company that makes D&D publishes them online for anyone to use for free.

## What are the core rules missing?
You can absolutely run a game with only the core rules; they’re mostly limited when it comes to character options. You don’t have as many options to choose from if you’ve only got the core rules, e.g. the PHB has 12 classes, the core rules only has 4.

It’s a good idea to borrow a copy of the PHB from someone to have on-hand when you create your character; if you pick options that aren’t in the core rules, take a picture of those pages in case you need to check them later. When it comes to actually playing the game, you’re probably fine to just have a copy of the core rules.

## Are there easier ways to access the options from the PHB and beyond?
Yes, these websites exist but unfortunately can't be linked here since they are illegal.
